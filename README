this is a bloxflip mines predictor in a discord bot, this is beta so none of this is gonna be 100% acurate
first, download python and then open cmd and type: pip install discord.py then add a discord bot to your server, after that download main.py.
next, get your discord token and paste it into the code in visual studio and save it and run it
then type in the discord chat "!predict (game_code) (amount of bombs)"
